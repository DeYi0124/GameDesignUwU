A bike! Sweet.
Unknown_pedo
Oi! Keep your dirty hand out of my precious bicycle MATE.
Me
Hey, no need for such language.
Unknown_pedo
Now get lost. You fucking muppet.
Me
I'm afraid not. It is my duty to protect the NTU. Besides you are being an asshole.
Unknown_pedo
Welp, I am someone you can't pick on. But I am willing to give you a chance. I am challenging you to a game of BlackJack.
Me
Why BlackJack, and why should I accept the challenge?
Unknown_pedo
To prove that you are worthy.Ever since the disappearance of Uncle SheiYuan, I've been looking for a worthy opponent.
Unknown_pedo
They call me Numerical Calculation Ultimate Player, or NCUP. I am a professional gambler.
Me
I don't think that you've heard me properly. Why would I participate in such game?

<b>*TRANSFORM*</b>
NCUP
I am not asking you. You accepted the deal the moment you decided to be a ShueiYuan intern. You wanted to protect the public, don't you?

Me
Why are there so many fucking freaks in this campus?
NCUP
You know the rules right? We keep dealing and try to get as close to 21 points as we can.
NCUP
If you think the points are good for now you can pass and let me deal.
NCUP
I will bet my bike and all the money I have for this. If you lose, I will take all your pocket money and leave with my bike.
