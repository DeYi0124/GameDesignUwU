I see...
Blahaj
Welp human, In order to be a part of the society, I am teaching my son the correct way to ride a bike.
blahaj
haj!
Me
Yeah. That sounds like a good activity for parents and children.
Blahaj
However, I need to buy a bike. And I see you've collect some.
Blahaj
Is it possible that I buy one of your bike?
blahaj
haj!
Me
Hmmmm....? I don't think it is okay for me to do that. Selling bikes while doing my daily task.
Blahaj
Oh... just one bike, they won't notice!
blahaj
haj....
Me
Hmmmmmmmmmmm, fine.

The two sharks took the bike away and gave you a packet of money.
System
You wonder how they ride the bike. The fact is, they can't. So they went home and left the bike after failing some attempts. You took the bike away anyway.
