I'm the biggest fan of DiGoLiang.
Me
Ok, whatever. I'm here to take your bike.
DigoLiangFan
NOOOOO, although it saddens me to say goodbye to my bike,I'll humbly accept my fate like my idol DiGoLiang would.
Me
ehh, actually, when I tried to take DiGoLiang's bike, he vanished into thin air along with his bike.
Me
He did give me two tickets to his GuatiaShow though.
