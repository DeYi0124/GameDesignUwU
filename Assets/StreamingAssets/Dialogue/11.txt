Hello, who are you?
DiGoLiangFan
I'm the biggest fan of DiGoLiang.
You
Ok, whatever. I'm here to take your bike.
DigoLiangFan
NOOOOO, although it saddens me to say goodbye to my bike,I'll humbly accept my fate like my idol DiGoLiang would.
You
ehh, actually, when I tried to take DiGoLiang's bike, he vanished into thin air along with his bike.
You
He did give me two tickets to his GuatiaShow though.
DiGoLiangFan
WHAT!! You have tickets to his GuatiaShow? PLSSSSS give me one and I'll tell everyone how great you are!

Sorry, I can't really give you a ticket. I also want to go the the GuatiaShow with my friend.
DiGoLiangFan
It's okay, I understand. Who wouldn't want to go to the GuatiaShow?
DiGoLiangFan
Take my bike then. I have nothing else to lose.
You

You took out a lighter and burned the ticket in front of DiGoLiangFan's face.
DiGoLiangFan
NOOOOOOOO!!! Why would you do that?
You
Because that asshole DiGoLiang almost got me fired by refusing to give me his bike.
You
This is my REVENGE! I'll make his fan atone for what he did to me! SUFFER AS I HAVE.
DiGoLiangFan
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
