A bike! Sweet.
NCUP
Oi! Keep your dirty hand out of my precious bicycle MATE.
Me
Hey, no need for such language.
NCUP
Now get lost. You fucking muppet.
Me
I am afraid not. It was my duty to protect the NTU. Besides you are being an asshole.
NCUP
Welp, I am someone you can't pick on. But I am willing to give you a chance. I am challenging you a BlackJack game.
Me
Why BlackJack, and why should I take the challenge?
NCUP
To prove that you are worthy. Since the old legend ShueiYuan is gone, my bikes hadn't been taken away by anyone.
NCUP
They call me Numerical Calculation Ultimate Player, or NCUP. I am a professional gambler.
Me
I don't think that you've heard me properly. Why would I participate in such game?

NCUPbjr
I am not asking you. You've accepted the deal since you decided to be a ShueiYuan intern. You wanted to protect the public, don't you?

Why the hell I always met such things everyday.
