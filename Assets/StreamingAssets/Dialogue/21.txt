A bike! Sweet.
unknown_pedo
Oi! Keep your dirty hand out of my precious bicycle MATE.
Me
Hey, no need for such language.
unknown_pedo
Now get lost. You fucking muppet.
Me
I am afraid not. It was my duty to protect the NTU. Besides you are being an asshole.
unknown_pedo
Welp, I am someone you can't pick on. But I am willing to give you a chance. I am challenging you a BlackJack game.
Me
Why BlackJack, and why should I take the challenge?
unknown_pedo
To prove that you are worthy. Since the old legend ShueiYuan is gone, my bikes hadn't been taken away by anyone.
unknown_pedo
They call me Numerical Calculation Ultimate Player, or NCUP. I am a professional gambler.
Me
I don't think that you've heard me properly. Why would I participate in such game?

<b>*TRANSFORM*</b>
NCUP
I am not asking you. You've accepted the deal since you decided to be a ShueiYuan intern. You wanted to protect the public, don't you?
NCUP

Me
Why the hell I always met such things everyday.
NCUP
You know the rules right? We keep dealing and try to get as close to the 21 point as we can.
NCUP
If you think the points are good for now you can pass and let me deal.
NCUP
I will bet my bike and all the money I have for this. If you lose, I will take all your pocket money and leave with my bike.
