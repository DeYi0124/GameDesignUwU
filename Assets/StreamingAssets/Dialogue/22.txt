Me
Students always like to park their bike in front of XinoFu square.
Me
I can always harvest a LARGE amount of bikes here.
Random_8+9
Yo, Kua san xiao la! (What are you looking at?)
Me
Excuse me? Oh wait...
Me
He must be speaking some random ancient language. I've seen this on a book, it is the 8+9 languages.
Random_8+9
So you speak English. You'd better not take my bike. Or you will be doomed. I am in charge of the streets of NTU.
Me
(He's one of the 8+9s. These people are not as strong as they seem to be. Especially when they are not in groups.)
Me
Welp, I think that it is not up to you. I am still gonna take the bike.
Random_8+9
Wait.. I can feel some aura from you. You must be the one that is following the path of old legend ShueiYuan.
Random_8+9
You shall not be around here. The XiaoFu square had already been controlled since the old legend's disappearance.
Random_8+9
(My group are not here so I can't do much...)
Random_8+9
Have all the bikes here. And next time you won't be so lucky.
 
Acquired all the bikes around XiaoFu Square.
