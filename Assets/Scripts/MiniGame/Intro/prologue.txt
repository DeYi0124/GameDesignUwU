Welcome to NTU.
A beautiful university, renowned for its stunning scenery and world-class education.
In the morning, you can enjoy a nice picnic by the lake, surrounded by nature's beauty.
In the evening, you can stay at the library, get lost in the pages of a book, or lay down on the grass and get ready for a night of stargazing.
But there is a dark side to NTU.
Under this peaceful facade, unbeknownst to most people, is a gruesome <color=red>WAR</color>.
On one side, are the lawless students and their illegal parking of bicycles.
For their own convenience, they will park thier bike anywhere, with utter disregard for the safety and order of the campus.
On the other side, is our Lord and Savior, Uncle SheiYuen (水源).
For decades, uncle SheiYuen had been a guardian of the people of NTU. He had been the last line of defence against the evil students.
He became a legendary figure of NTU, it was rumored that bicyles would sometimes spontaneously fly into his truck out of sheer respect for him.
With Uncle SheiYuen, NTU was safe once again.
But one day, he <color=red>vanished</color>.
With his mysterious disappearance, there was no one left to protect the campus.
The evil students ran rampant, and the campus was in utter chaos.
As people cried out for help, frantically searching for a new savior.
You thought to yourself
"Maybe I can save the day. Maybe this is the chance I've been waiting for."
With unwavering determination, you head to the SheiYuen office.
In order to save the world, you must...
Become a SheiYuen intern!!!
